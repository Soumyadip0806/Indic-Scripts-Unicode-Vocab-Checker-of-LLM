# **Indic Unicode Vocab Checker**  

🚀 **Analyze the Unicode coverage of 13 Indic language scripts in any model's vocabulary!**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This pipeline is designed to evaluate how well a language model supports 13 Indic scripts by analyzing its vocabulary. It works with transformer-based models such as **LLaMA, Phi, Gemma, IndicTrans, IndicBART, Lamini, T5, MuRIL, mBERT, etc**, and more.  

### 🔍 **Key Features**  
✅ Unicode dataset covering 13 Indic scripts.  
✅ Checks vocabulary size of any language model.  
✅ Identifies present and missing Unicode characters per script.  
✅ Supports popular transformer-based models (Hugging Face & custom models).  
✅ Simple and efficient pipeline for quick analysis.  

## 🏗 **Supported Scripts**  
This tool evaluates Unicode support for the following Indic scripts:  

- **Bangla** 
- **Perso-Arabic**  
- **Gurmukhi**  
- **Gujarati** 
- **Devanagari** (Indo-Aryan)  
- **Devanagari** (Sino-Tibetan)   
- **Odia**  
- **Tamil**  
- **Telugu**  
- **Kannada**  
- **Malayalam**   
- **Ol-Chiki**  
- **Meitei**  

## 📊 **What This Tool Provides**  
- **Total vocabulary size of the model.**  
- **Coverage percentage for each script.**  
- **List of missing Unicode characters for better linguistic insights.**  

## 💡 **Why Use This?**  
🔹 Evaluate multilingual models for Indic script support.  
🔹 Identify gaps in tokenization and vocabulary coverage.  
🔹 Improve language model development for low-resource languages.  
🔹 Gain insights into Indic script representation in AI models.
